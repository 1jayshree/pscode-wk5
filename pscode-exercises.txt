// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Create variable = a (7)

Create variable =b (9)

Create variable = Sum

Enter the value of a

Enter the value of b

Add the numbers a,b to sum (a + b = Sum)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
 
Take the value of sum and divide by 2 

(sum / 2)

If sum is divisible by 2 

Print number is even

If sum is not divisible by 2 

Print "number is odd "


// Exercise 3: ) Calculate the average of the five numbers.  
 
Read in 5 separate numbers.

Create 5 variables (a, b, c, d, e)

Create variable Sum 

Create Variable average

Enter value for a

Enter value for b

Enter value for c

Enter value for d

Enter value for e 

//Add all the values to create a sum //

(a+b+c+d+e = Sum)

Divide Sum by 5 to get average 

(sum/5 = average)

Print " This is the Average of all 5 Numbers"
  
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

int[] getMinMax(int A[], int n)
{
    int max = A[0]
    int min = A[0]
    for ( i = 1 to n-1 )
    {
        if ( A[i] > max )
            max = A[i]
        else if ( A[i] < min )
            min = A[i]
    }

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

print("Maximum:", max)

Print(minimum", min)
